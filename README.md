tinymce4-mathslate
==================

This is the Mathslate editor adapted as a standard plugin for TinyMCE4. In
order to install Mathslate into a local installation of TinyMCE4, copy
plugins/mathslate to tinymce/js/tinymce/plugins/mathslate. You may
need to change the url at the top of plugin/mathslate/mathslate.html
to a different value to use https. Otherwise you may run TinyMCE4
from CDN by copying this directory to a web server, or by visiting
https://dthies.github.io/tinymce4-mathslate.

TinyMCE plugin.
